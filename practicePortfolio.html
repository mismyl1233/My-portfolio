<h2>Welcome to my portfolio!!</h2><div class="hello-content"><div><p>I am enrolled at Thinkful, learning everything related to creating webpages: the programming languages, the systems involved, front-end, and back-end! I am new to this (not counting a few classes in college many years ago!) and am learning so much every day!! I am very excited about this opportunity and what the future holds for me in this wonderful career choice!!</p></div></div></section><!--Horizontal rule dividing the divs--><hr><!--About Me Section --><section id="about" class="about"><h3>About Me</h3><div class="about-content"><div><h2>Here are three things to know about me:</h2><!--nested lists about me--><p>I currently live in Orlando, FL, but I have lived all over the USA: North Carolina, South Carolina,California, New Mexico, Georgia, and New York. I also lived in Costa Rica for a year when I was three years old,but I don't remember much about that! The pictures are amazing, however, and I would love to return for avisit.</p><p>I have worked in many career fields: restaurant industry, office manager for a thriving real estate company(Ilearned marketing and graphic design skills), online poker champion. I was also a jewelry maker and designer (the main focus was creating malanecklaces, but also custom gifts such as bridesmaid presents).</p><p> I was in a random accident four years ago that left me unable to walk without a cane, and not for long distances. This accident changed my life in so many ways! After trying to turn my passion (making beautiful jewelry) into a career, I have decided to study software engineering. I still love designing and making jewelry as a hobby, but the cost of materials/time spent did not equate into a viable pay. I also can't return to the restaurant industry because of my leg, but even though I enjoyed the challenging, fast-paced aspect of the job, and made many good friends, I never wanted to grow old/retire from that career. There is a silver lining to everything in life, and my accident has made me motivated and very strong.</p><!-- lists about me--><h2>Here are some of my skills that will benefit you:</h2><ul><li>I never take an opportunity for granted! Life has humbled me greatly, and I have gained a new perspective and appreciation for everything.</li><li>My professional communication skills: over ten years in the restaurant industry, depending on happy customers to make a living has made me able to keep a cool demeanor no matter how frustrated I may be. Iwas also an office manager at a high-end real estate office, so I interacted with people in a very professional atmosphere as well. </li><li>I'm very eager to learn: my brain works in a way that I cannot stop learning about a subject that I'm interested in until I know every single detail. People have always told me that I should try-out for Jeopardy because I have a lot of knowledge about a lot of subjects! </li><li>My problem-solving mindset- I've been winning at complex games such as chess and Tetris since I was asmall child. Later in life, I became very interested in poker and after studying the intricacies of the game(such as math, patience, discipline, equity(pot odds, risk vs. reward), and more!). Many former and current poker players have chosen software engineering because these skills serve them very well in this career field.</li></ul></div></div></section><!--Horizontal rule dividing the divs--><hr><!-- Project Section--><h3>Projects</h3><section id="projects" class="projects"><h2>Project Title- Stay Tuned!</h2><div><a href="https://github.com/mismyl123" target="blank">Github</a><a href="https://github.com/mismyl123" target="blank">Live Site</a><img src="projectPlaceholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder Image" style="width:250px; height:250px;"></div><h2>Project Title- Stay Tuned!</h2><div><a href="https://github.com/mismyl123" target="blank">Github</a><a href="https://github.com/mismyl123" target="blank">Live Site</a><img src="projectPlaceholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder Image" style="width:250px; height:250px;"></div>
